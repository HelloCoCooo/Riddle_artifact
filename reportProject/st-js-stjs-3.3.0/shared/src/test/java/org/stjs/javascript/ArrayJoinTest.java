// Tests section 15.4.4.5 of the ECMA-262 Spec
// ===========================================
// Note: Since the toString() tests always verify that the result of toString() and join()
// are the same, some of the tests in the test262 suite have been omitted, since they are
// basically a duplicate of what is done via toString().
//
// All the remaining tests focus on verifying that toString() is called on the "separator"
// argument. However, this makes no sense for us, because the ST-JS version of join() takes
// defines the "separator" argument to be a String.
//
// So basically, no tests were ported for that section
