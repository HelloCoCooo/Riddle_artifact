== Usages

When you change files in your Wisdom project, this one triggers an undeploy/redeploy of the application. This reload is listened by this extension which send over websocket a signal to browser. This signal, in turn, reload the page **when** the bundle used to display current page is changed.

Notice that, as the listening code is only added on HTML files, this will hardly work on pure Javascript modules.

== Configuration
There is no configuration required at all.
