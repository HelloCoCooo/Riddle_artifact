== Package, Test, Run your application

Wisdom's build system is based on Apache Maven, so the build process is following the _default_
Maven lifecycle.

=== Package your application

`mvn package` creates two files: a jar file containing your application, and a zip file containing the whole
distribution, ready to be deployed.

NOTE: The jar file is an OSGi bundle.

=== Adding dependencies

To add a dependency to your application, just add a `<dependency>` in the `pom.xml`. Wisdom copies all dependencies
from the `compile` scope (default Maven scope):

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>asm</groupId>
	<artifactId>asm-all</artifactId>
	<version>3.3.1</version>
</dependency>
----

However notice two important rules:

 1. It does not copy transitive dependencies, so don't forget to declare all your dependencies.
 2. Only OSGi bundles are copied, so check that your dependencies are valid OSGi bundles.

IMPORTANT: Most libraries are OSGi bundles already.

=== Finding bundles

Unfortunately, you may want to use a library that is not a bundle. When facing this situation, you have 3 choices:

1. Trying to find a _bundlelized_ version of the library
2. Use the _non-OSGi dependency_ support of Wisdom - Check the <<Using non-OSGi dependencies>> section
3. Make your own bundle (that you can contribute to the project) - Check the <<Some bundelization rules>> section

You may want to check the bundles available on:

* http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.servicemix.bundles[Service Mix Bundles] - Apache Service Mix have
created lots of bundles of all the dependencies they use
* http://ebr.springsource.com/repository/app/[Spring Source OSGi Repository] - Spring Source has also created a bunch
 of bundles you can find on their _Enterprise Bundle Repository_

=== Using non-OSGi dependencies

Unfortunately, not all libraries are OSGi bundles. Fortunately, Wisdom supports non-bundle dependencies. These
dependencies are copied to the `libs` directory of the Wisdom server and are called _libraries_. These dependencies
does not need to be OSGi bundles, and can be used by the Wisdom applications.

First add your Maven dependency as usual such as:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.pegdown</groupId>
  <artifactId>pegdown</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.2</version>
</dependency>
----

Then, you need to select explicitly the libraries from the set of dependencies. Only selected dependencies are
copied. This selection is made as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
  <artifactId>wisdom-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
  <extensions>true</extensions>
  <configuration>
    <!-- Defines the set of 'libraries' -->
    <libraries>
      <includes>
        <!--
        defines the set of dependencies to select as library (mandatory).
        it uses the following syntax: groupId:artifactId:type[:classifier]:version
        -->
        <include>:pegdown</include>
      </includes>

      <!--
      whether or not transitive dependencies of the selected libraries should also
      be copied (default to true). only 'compile' dependencies are copied.
      -->
      <resolveTransitive>true</resolveTransitive>

      <!--
      whether or not the selected artifacts should be excluded from the 'application'
       directory (default to false).
      -->
      <excludeFromApplication>true</excludeFromApplication>

      <!--
      allow to exclude some artifacts. This feature is useful when transitive support
      is enabled to filter out undesirable artifacts.
      -->
      <excludes>
        <exclude>:asm-tree</exclude>
      </excludes>
    </libraries>
  </configuration>
</plugin>
----

The `libraries` element configure the selection and behavior. It must contains an `includes` element with at least
one `include` sub-element. If none are set, no dependencies are considered as libraries.

Using libraries allows you to rely on non-bundle dependencies, but it comes with a couple of limitations:

* the set of libraries is static, so cannot change after the wisdom server has started.
* there is no dependency resolution at runtime, meaning that all dependencies required by selected libraries must
also be available from the 'libs' directory.

In other word, libraries are very useful when you can't find a suitable OSGi bundle, but need to be used carefully to
not break the modularity and dynamism of your applications.

NOTE: The content of the jar files contained in the `libs` directory are exported by the OSGi framework.

IMPORTANT: This feature only works when using Apache Felix.

=== Some bundelization rules

If you want to create your own OSGi bundle, here are some rules:

* Inspect the library to separate the public API from the private / implementation parts - this is particularly
important to avoid exposing implementation details.
*  Detect http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#loadClass(java.lang.String)[ClassLoader.loadClass] calls, http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#findResource(java.lang.String)[ClassLoader.findResource], and more generally all `ClassLoader` access
* Check whether the code rely on the _Thread Context ClassLoader_, if so, wrap the calls with a TTCL Switch:

[source,java]
----
final ClassLoader original = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
try {
    Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(this.getClass().getClassLoader());
    // your code using the library.
} finally {
    Thread.currentThread().setContextClassLoader(original);
}
----

* Detect SPI usage, and try to see if you can create the instance manually and inject it
* Last but not least, design a service interface, to avoid leaking the whole API - and if itâ€™s possible, make the service interface independent of the library (meaning that you can substitute by another one someday)

=== Run tests

Tests are situated in the `src/test/java` directory.

`mvn test` executes all the unit tests following the Surefire convention. So, it executes all tests from classes
starting or finishing by `Test`, such as `MyClassTest` or `TestMyClass`.

`mvn integration-test` executes all the integration tests following the Surefire convention. So, it executes all tests
from classes starting or finishing by `IT`, such as `MyComponentIT` or `ITMyComponent`..

Unit tests are also executed in _watch mode_. It re-executes the unit tests when you change either a Java class or a
test. By default, all test are re-executed. However, to reduce the amount of test, use:

----
<testSelectionPolicy>SELECTIVE</testSelectionPolicy>
----

With the `SELECTIVE` policy, only related tests are executed. Notice that, test failures are reported in the browser.
 You can skip tests adding the `-DskipTests` flag to the Maven command line.

=== Watch mode

To run the application while developing, launch:

----
mvn wisdom:run
----

It packages your application and starts the Wisdom server. It also _watches_ changes you make on your files and
redeploys _things_ automatically. For instance, if you edit a Java file, it compiles,
packages and redeploys the application.

WARNING: Modifying the `pom.xml` file relaunches the server automatically.

The wisdom watch mode allows you to use a _remote_ Wisdom server. Using this feature, you can
_watch_ several project at the same time. To enable this feature launch the watch mode with
`-DwisdomDirectory=location`.

So, imagine you have two projects, `P1` and `P2`, and `P2` depends on `P1`. You want to enjoy the
_watch_ mode on both `P1` and `P2` projects, but, as `P2` is your _final_ / _main_ project, you
also want to immediately copy the `P1`  output to `P2`. In this context, just launch the _watch_
mode twice as follows:

----
# P2 - regular watch mode (it starts the server we are going to use in P1)
mvn wisdom:run
----

----
# P1 - watch mode with remote server
mvn wisdom:run -DwisdomDirectory=../p2/target/wisdom
----

TIP: Launch the main server first, if not, it may override the copied resources.

WARNING: When you launch the _watch_ mode with the `wisdomDirectory`, some copy functionality
is disabled  (configuration and external resources). So in our previous example, modifying the
`P1` configuration, external resources, or templates do not copy them to `P2`. However, as `P2`
is launched without the parameter, all features are provided.

TIP: The watch mode is based on a File Alteration Monitor (FAM). The default polling period is set to 2 seconds. You
can configure it using `-Dwatch.period=5`. The set time is in **seconds**.


=== Debugging

In watch mode, you can enable the remote debugging by using the `-Ddebug=port`:

----
mvn wisdom:run -Ddebug=5005
----

Then, just launch the debug mode of your IDE using the set port (5005 in the previous example).

=== Run the application

The application is assembled in the `target/wisdom` directory. You can run it without the watch mode using:

----
./chameleon.sh
----

TIP:Why Chameleon? Because Chameleon is a kind of OSGi distribution with some additional features on which Wisdom
relies.

=== Accessing the OSGi shell

If you are an OSGi expert and want to access the _shell_ launch the application with:

----
./chameleon.sh --interactive
----

The provided shell is http://shelbie.ow2.org/[OW2 Shelbie].

=== The distribution

`mvn package` generates an OSGi bundle (a jar file) and a zip file. The jar file can be deployed into any other
wisdom application. The zip file contains the whole distribution and can be run using the same shell script as
previously explained.

=== Customizing applications packaging

Wisdom applications are packaged inside OSGi bundles. By default it:

* includes all classes (from `src/main/java`) and resources (from `src/main/resources`)
* imports all required packages (deduced by analyzing the classes)
* exports all packages containing `service(s)`, `api(s)`, `model(s)`, `entity` or `entities`

However, sometimes you want to customize this default packaging policy. Wisdom relies on
http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Bnd[BND] to build bundles. BND is building the OSGi bundle by following a set of _instructions_
 such as:

----
Import-Package: com.library.*; version = 1.21
----


To customize the bundle of your application, create a `osgi.bnd` file in `src/main/osgi/`,
and write the BND instructions there.

For example, the Wisdom Hibernate Validation bundle has the following instructions:

----
Private-Package: org.wisdom.validation.hibernate;-split-package:=merge-first,  \
    org.jboss.logging.*, \
    com.fasterxml.classmate.*, \
    org.hibernate.validator*, \
    com.sun.el*, \
    javax.el*
Import-Package: javax.validation.*;version="[1.1.0,2.0.0)", \
                !org.apache.log4j, \
                org.jsoup*;resolution:=optional, \
                javax.persistence*;resolution:=optional, \
                org.jboss.logmanager*;resolution:=optional, \
                *
Export-Package: org.hibernate.validator.constraints*
----

TIP: The `osgi.bnd` file can use Maven properties.

When used, the `osgi.bnd` file is merged with the default instructions used by Wisdom (`Import-Package`,
`Export-Package` (based on the package name), `Private-Package`, and `Include-Resource`). In other words, every
instructions specified in the `osgi.bnd` replaces default value provided by Wisdom for this instruction. For example,
 if your `osgi.bnd` file contains `Export-Package: my.package.to.be.exported`, it won't compute the default exported
 packages, but use your value (and only your value).

You can completely disable the Wisdom defaults, by adding the following instruction in the `osgi.bnd` file:

----
-no-default: true
----

=== Embedding Maven dependencies inside the application package

You can declare a set of (Maven) dependency to be packaged within the application bundle. The Wisdom Maven Plugin
supports embedding of selected project dependencies inside the bundle by using the `Embed-Dependency` instruction:

----
Embed-Dependency: dependencies
----

where:

----
dependencies ::= clause ( ',' clause ) *
clause ::= MATCH ( ';' attr '=' attribute | ';inline=' inline | ';transitive=' transitive)
attr ::= 'scope' | 'type' | 'classifier' | 'optional'
transitive ::= 'true' | 'false'
inline ::= 'true' | 'false' | PATH ( '|' PATH ) *
attribute ::= <value> ( '|' <value> ) *
MATCH ::= <Maven Pattern Dependency Filter ([groupId]:[artifactId]:[type]:[version])>
PATH ::= <Ant-style path expression>
----

The plugin uses the `Embed-Dependency` instruction to transform the project dependencies into `Include-Resource` and
 `Bundle-ClassPath` clauses, which are then appended to the current set of instructions and passed onto BND.

Let's see some examples:

----
# embed all compile and runtime scope dependencies
Embed-Dependency: *;scope=compile|runtime

# embed any dependencies with artifactId junit and scope runtime
Embed-Dependency: junit;scope=runtime

# embed all compile and runtime scope dependencies, except those with artifactIds in the given list
Embed-Dependency: *;scope=compile|runtime;inline=false;exclude=:cli|:lang|:runtime|:tidy|:jsch

# inline contents of selected folders from all dependencies
Embed-Dependency: *;inline=images/**|icons/**
----

Normally the plugin only checks direct dependencies, but this can be changed to include the complete set of transitive
dependencies with the following option:

----
Embed-Transitive: true
----

It can also be enabled using the `transitive=true` attribute.

IMPORTANT: Be aware that Wisdom is using 1) a different syntax than the Maven-Bundle-Plugin to select the set of
artifacts, 2) Inline artifacts by default

=== Configuring the Java source and target

By default, Wisdom compiles your code using Java 1.7. This convention was made to stick with the Maven convention.
However you can override these settings by adding the following properties in your `pom.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<properties>
        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
        <maven.compiler.testSource>1.8</maven.compiler.testSource>
        <maven.compiler.testTarget>1.8</maven.compiler.testTarget>
</properties>
----

=== Adding instance configuration

You can add `cfg` file into the `src/main/instances` directory to add them to the `wisdom/application` directory.
`cfg` files let you configure iPOJO instances (instantiation, configuration and reconfiguration). This directory is
_watched_ so changes are reflected immediately.

The file are filtered, so can rely on Maven properties.

The `cfg` file format is defined in the http://ow2-chameleon.github.io/core/snapshot/chameleon-directory-monitor.html#configuration_deployment[Configuration deployment section].

These files are packaged in the distribution but not in the bundle. So, if an application relies on a component
requiring a specific instance configuration, this configuration need to be copied. If the configuration is static,
you should use the `@Configuration` support of
http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo/apache-felix-ipojo-userguide/apache-felix-ipojo-instances.html#configuration[iPOJO].
