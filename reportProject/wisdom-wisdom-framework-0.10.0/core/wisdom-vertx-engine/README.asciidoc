= Vertx Wisdom Engine


== Configuration

In the `src/main/configuration/application.conf` file, use these properties to configure the ports:

----
http.port => HTTP port, 9000 by default
https.port = HTTPS port, disabled by default
vertx.http.port = equivalent to http.port
vertx.https.port = equivalent to https.port
----

You can use `-1` to disable the frontend, and `0` to use a random port.

Others properties are:
* `vertx.acceptBacklog` : the size of the accept backlog
* `vertx.maxWebSocketFrameSize` : the max size of the web socket frame
* `vertx.receiveBufferSize` : the receive buffer size
* `vertx.sendBufferSize` : the receive buffer size
